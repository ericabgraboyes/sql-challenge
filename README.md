## Background:
For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Instructions:
Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

### Data Modeling:
Create entity relationship diagram of the tables
can use free online resources like https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

### Data Engineering:
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
  * specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
  * Import each csv to the corrospending SQL table

### Data Analysis:
* (1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee 
* (2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986
* (3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name
* (4) List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* (5) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B
* (6) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name
* (7) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
* (8) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
